## Vision Statement 
 
1. This is a medication tracker app that helps individuals get reminders to take their medication. It also gives the individual extra information about the medication. 
2. The app works by allowing the user to insert the name of the medication along with number of pills and frequency of use. The app would then use this information to organize a calendar to show the dates of when the medication needs to be taken and when the medication runs out. The app would also notify the user a week prior when the medication runs out. The app would also show the user all the current medication they are taking.
